The problem with trouble shooting is that trouble shoots back
You have the capacity to learn from your mistakes and you will learn a lot today
Help stamp out eliminate and abolish redundancy
If nothing was learned nothing was taught
When everything is coming your way you are in the wrong lane
I do not have a solution but I do admire the problem 
I started with nothing and I still have most of it
Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity
Talk is cheap Until you hire a lawyer
Time does not exist Clocks exists
